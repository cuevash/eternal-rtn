# Plan

## Goal

Become an expert as Data Analyst / Data Scientist

## Plan - Next Monts

### Keep acquiring knowledge of the field

* Can be summarized in becoming expert on the topics covered on the books:
  * **The Elements of Statistical Learning** 
  * **An Introduction to Statistical Learning**
* Statistics
* R language (Priority)
* Python
* Excel
* PowerBI
* Tableau
* Data Engineering
It is becoming important each day, a data analyst need to be able to gather it own data and handle it professionally. Big companies will have a role associated to it, but in small ones you will be expected to be able to be competent by yourself. Summarizing the whole lifecycle of a data project needs to be master
  * Big Data
    * Airbyte
    * Big Query
    * Snowflake? or Databrics or .. something else
  * Prefect or Dagster or 
  * Git and DVC
  * Others.. 


### Practice & Repetition (10,000 Hours :-))

* Learn by heart the above skills through grinding practice
* Best ways is to make small projects and create a Portfolio at the same time
* Ask people about possible Data projects that may make sense to them and offer to do them by little money or free. Adding real experience this way.
  * Josu?
  * ONGs
  * University
  * Bea? Some psychology data
  * Amescua
  * Others?
  * ...
  
### Portfolio

Creating a cool and varied Portfolio is the best way to achieve most of the things to either
get a job of generate dynamics to start getting jobs as freelancer/agency.

* Set a goal of creating different types of small projects that show all the skills learned
  * Kaggle Blogs
  * Towards Data Science Blogs
  * Small projects in Github showing Data Analyst skills
  * Small projects in Github showing Data Science skills
  * Daily graphs - Instagram/Twitter
  Create small interesting graphs almost daily. R visualization is quite powerful for this.
    * Stock data
    * Others
    * 
* Projects on the data engineering side of things (Medium master here..)
  * Big Data
    * Airbyte
    * Big Query
    * Snowflake? or Databrics or .. something else
  * Prefect or Dagster or 
  * Others.. 


### Jobs - In the short term

Getting jobs as Data Analyst/Data Scientist can be challenge in the very short term, because I still need to get more knowledge and build a better portfolio. So It could be easier to stick to jobs related to:

* Do QLM modelization for a few more months
* If web side grows I could help doing with Webflow webs.
* Data Modelization & Visualization 
* Promoting myself more in various sites..
  * Which ones?
  * Malt
  * Toptotal? Maybe no yet..
  * Jobserve
  * Infojobs
  * Europe ? 
    * Remote Work?
    * Part time?
* PowerBI 
This of course imply most of the time some modelization and lots of visualization
  * Dashboards
* Some data engineering
This is to build some infrastructure to collect , store and transform data and make it ready to be further analyzed and visualized


### Jobs - In the Medium term

Yes! This is the golden egg goal! 

* Data Modelization & Visualization 
* PowerBI 
This of course imply most of the time some modelization and lots of visualization
  * Dashboards
* Some data engineering
This is to build some infrastructure to collect , store and transform data and make it ready to be further analyzed and visualized

### Challenges

* Improve writing skills
* Improve communication skills
