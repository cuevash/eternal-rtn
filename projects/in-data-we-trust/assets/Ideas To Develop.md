# Ideas to Develop

## Modellization videos
  * Create a family of videos tackling ever increasing complexity.
  * Each video solve a family of problems with an elegant modelization
    * Explaining the use of the typical measures associated to such model that solves the typical problems.
  * To do this create a list of examples, to be solved. typical way to modelize ( that is sometimes too complex or flat wrong) and then show the real example that solve it..
  * Also videos related to machine learning and IA such as
    * Linear regresion
    * R and Skipy algorithms ..
      * Clusterizarion
      * ...
  * Comparing performance of different ways of doing things:
    * Running Total power query
      * Curbal
      * https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/quickly-create-running-totals-in-power-query
    * Running total grouped  
  * How to clean/validate data
  * How to test that a modelization returns valid data and without errors.
  * How to handle errors when modelizing? It is possible that some incorret or unexpeteced data generates errors, how to handle them in the most unobtrusive way. The mos gracefully way. 
  * Managing precision in m

## Machine learning and PowerBI

* How to organize machine learning inside powerbi vs a normal datawarehouse..?


## Add courses in coursera in english/spanish

* Have a look to : -> ## Machine learning and PowerBI

## Stock forecasting -> Time series

## Birth rate prediction -> Linear regression

## Population growth forecasting

## Process examples
  - How to clean data
  - How to validate data
  - How to validate algorithms // How to validate code in python//R
  - How to get data, store it , process it.. ETL/ELT and whole process.. How to productize ML models,
  specialy on the cloud. Which tools can be used to productize the whole data analisys with its ML models developed..

## PowerBI QLM
* Proposal of advanced analytics
* Proposal of out of this world dashboard looking.. streching the design.. but still not to complicate to do.. 

## Ecomerce
* Luiso designing pretty cool stuff for skaters..
* Ecommerce easy to but with a amazing design..!
* With section for blogging about skating..
  * Where to go
  * Whom to meet
  * Classes
  * Cool videos done by the master yayo skaters..

## As QLM
* Develop a financial/other tool ..with an operational plane and a reporting plane
with PowerBI and others..

## Present Bilayer as businnes analysis/ data analyis / Data science..
* In diferrent fields like:
  * Financial
  * Distribution
  * Prices of goods... variance.. prediction.

## A data science proyect with huge data..

## Prepare a presentation for üëç
  * Powerbi methods
  * Data science/data analysis example..!

## Visualization of all the people we are connected to.
