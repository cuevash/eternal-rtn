# Ideas to Develop

## Modellization videos

* Create a family of videos tackling ever increasing complexity.
* Each video solve a family of problems with an elegant modelization
  * Explaining the use of the typical measures associated to such model that solves the typical problems.
* To do this create a list of examples, to be solved. typical way to modelize ( that is sometimes too complex or flat wrong) and then show the real example that solve it..
* Also videos related to machine learning and IA such as
  * Linear regresion
  * R and Skipy algorithms ..
    * Clusterizarion
    * ...
* Comparing performance of different ways of doing things:
  * Running Total power query
    * Curbal
    * <https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/quickly-create-running-totals-in-power-query>
  * Running total grouped  
* How to clean/validate data
* How to test that a modelization returns valid data and without errors.
* How to handle errors when modelizing? It is possible that some incorret or unexpeteced data generates errors, how to handle them in the most unobtrusive way. The mos gracefully way.
* Managing precision in m

## Machine learning and PowerBI

* How to organize machine learning inside powerbi vs a normal datawarehouse..?

## Add courses in coursera in english/spanish

* Have a look to : -> ## Machine learning and PowerBI

## Stock forecasting -> Time series

## Birth rate prediction -> Linear regression

## Population growth forecasting

## Process examples

* How to clean data
* How to validate data
* How to validate algorithms // How to validate code in python//R
* How to get data, store it , process it.. ETL/ELT and whole process.. How to productize ML models,
  specialy on the cloud. Which tools can be used to productize the whole data analisys with its ML models developed..

## PowerBI QLM

* Proposal of advanced analytics
* Proposal of out of this world dashboard looking.. streching the design.. but still not to complicate to do..

## Ecomerce

* Luiso designing pretty cool stuff for skaters..
* Ecommerce easy to but with a amazing design..!
* With section for blogging about skating..
  * Where to go
  * Whom to meet
  * Classes
  * Cool videos done by the master yayo skaters..

## As QLM

* Develop a financial/other tool ..with an operational plane and a reporting plane
with PowerBI and others..

## Present Bilayer as businnes analysis/ data analyis / Data science

* In diferrent fields like:
  * Financial
  * Distribution
  * Prices of goods... variance.. prediction.

## A data science proyect with huge data

## Prepare a presentation for üëç

* Powerbi methods
* Data science/data analysis example..!

## Visualization of all the people we are connected to

## Prediction of crime in spain by city, in Europe

## Casa encendida post-covid paneles con fotos

## Build dashboard of subjects with little programming

* Find no code platform that allow the creation of interactive web pages with nice graphics.
* But that it implements the logic of handling the data.. so they are quite flexible. soe they are more than infographics.

## PowerBI - Blog Entry

* How to apply in a cool and consistent way filter by measure at report level.
  * By a hidden slicer over the field to be filter, and a filter measure applied to the slicer.

## Data science

* Propose to QLM some data science project.. If possible getting some money.. But I would do it without money to get more experience.

## Data science

Agriculture Greenhouse Detection Using Aerial Images
Agriculture Greenhouse Detection Using Aerial Images  
The greenhouse project has been using Earth Observation data to identify greenhouses and measure their total area in Canada, in addition to a proof of concept to determine our..

* Something with images and recognizing something could be cool indeed!

## Cookiecutter

* Make sense to create maybe two simple templates:
  * One that uses some simple data.csv file stored locally in the git repo
  * Other that uses some external data , s3, apis, url, git repo etc. And some initial stage to get that data.

* Both templates should have a simple stage with the standard workflow steps of this type of project.
for instance: get-data, trasnform-data, generate-model.

## PowerBI

* Define workflows for different types of projects (complexity) and all of them with BACKUP!!

## PowerBI

* Imagine possible data analysis to offer to different companies.
  * Exploratory analysis
  * Production analysis with a clear objective and a system to put it into production

## Data analyst

* The number of stars and average customer satisfaction in Google Maps do not consider that a lot of the entries could be old one.. How to create a layer to that that will show a more accurate picture of what the people think about a place recently?

## Data analyst

* Predict something from a good database of satellite images.

## SpreadSheet

* How to handle spredsheet as a real Database? How to use a language like SQL on them?
  * On Excel (PowerQuery? // DAX)
  * On google sheets -> what can I use
  * Airtable or similars ? Which query language can I use on them?

## Organizing

* How to organize the digital life of a person? That could be a program.. That takes care of your digital life...
* But seriously lets start with me.. unclutter the digial self!!
* Put it on the objectives.

## Organizing

* How to handle big files and security issues. So How can I access big files using BigQuey.. If to use a big file I need to upload to google storage.. How can I do that and still make the access secure? Or could I upload the file directly into BigQuery?

## Project

* Trabajo en negro en espa√±a por autonomia, provicina.. evoluci√≥n, parte del pib, por sector
  * Emplead@s de hogar
  * Servicios
  * Hosteleria
  * Etc.

## Project

* Hablar con Amescua para crear un proyecto para la Carlos III

## Enonometris??

* Maybe is a good direction to get into ONGs

## Examples that show the value that some work will add to your businesses

Choose two industries and think and do examples of how data analyst add value to their bussiness.
Look for what is already there and invent two other possible scenarios.

## Create documents explaining the main workflows

Document that explain in detail the whole process of a data analyst project. Including the tools needed and how to manage the data and all the intermediate work done with modern tools..
Excel could be good for small analysis.. but will you keep your changes in just a text journal file or will you add something more sphisticated , like git etc.

## See the twiters of luz frias to get inspirations about what type of thing to do and to post

## Go deep with the data in the world bank

* They have lost of studies that can be promising to understand better how to capture and analyze different indicators.. The HCI indicators could be good to get a job in an ONG that study these types of things.

## Fucking Jarvis with AI!! For the average Joe

* Life is getting so fucking complicated.. passwords,
* Bureaucracy
  * Things to do
  * IBI
  * Taxes
  * Crypto
  * Unemployment
  * ...

## Fullstack Jobs

* Some companies are contacting me about the fullstack prowess. So I may dedicate some time to the backend of things..
but balance that with the focus on data.

## Workflows

* Sometimes the most difficult part of a job is to have a good overview of all the tasks that need to be done and in which order, and which deliverables each phase is supposed to create. And where are the deliverables supposed to be saved, and which tools to use.. etc. You get the idea. 
It would be such a great thing to have documents for each type of project that serves as a template, where you may change a few tools, a few places, cloud where the things get saved, but at the end of the day the process is the same for all those scenarios. The problems are the same, the obstacles are the same and a lot of times the way to overcome all of that can be done in a reproducible way for most of the problems.

* There could be some videos coming out of this.. dont you think?
## DB

* Learn about how the DB works internally, how it handles temporary tables on the calculations, ways to structure the SQL code to improve performance. How to check the plan by the database. 
So in general how to check the performace of the DB and how to monitor and analyze it. And of course how
to improve performance.


## Create stories

* Very important to create engaging data stories to tell. The way you tell them is very important.
Communication is key on here!
