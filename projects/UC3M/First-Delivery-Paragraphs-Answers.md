# First Delivery Paragraph Answers

## Subject group 96

Preliminary Delivery Group 96

## All

Hi,

For final delivery:

It is important to follow the structure and format of the tabs provided in the 'Team xx-ControlCard-v 1.0 File'. Tab "Project Data" or "README", "Methodology" etc...

Have it in mind when delivering the final project.

Small example of the tab "Methodology" in "Aula Global" -> "Final Project" -> "Example Preliminary Delivery"

## Address

I would like to address a few things:

## Members

- The Excel file does not contain any information about the group or its members.
Please send me the members of the group with the information requested per member as in the file "'Team xx-ControlCard-v 1.0 File'"

## Capabilities

- The capabilities explained in step 2 seem to be too generic. It was expected that something more specific would be provided regarding what the dashboards would offer.

## 3 & 6

- There seems to be some confusion regarding steps 3 and 6. Please refer to the 'Example Preliminary Delivery' file in 'Aula Global' for a small example of these steps.

## Data

- The most important point. It is important to note that it is not clear which dataset you are using for the project. To assess whether the data is adequate for the project, I will need you to provide the table or tables that you will use. Simply stating that you are getting data from some place is insufficient. Please provide this information as soon as possible so that we can ensure that the data is adequate to meet all the requirements of the final project.

- Provide a URL links that grants access to publicly accessible csv, txt, excel files or similar. Alternatively, provide links that allow for an online preview, such as on Kaggle.
- Share links to Google Drive files in csv, txt, excel format or similar, with read permissions granted for easy access.
