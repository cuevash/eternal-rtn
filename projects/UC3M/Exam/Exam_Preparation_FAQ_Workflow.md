# EXAM

## Preparation

* I have reviewed my own exam. Review the exam of Monday A
* Have the solutions to both exams and a perfect understanding of the questions.
* Know how to connect to "Aula Virtual" and run the Excel there.

## WORKFLOW

* Students get a seat
  * The put their ID card on the table with some picture

* Activate the meet reunion and ask the students to turn on their cameras and show an ID on the camera. And then leave the camera on.

* Teacher explained briefly the exam and the documents to be uploaded.
  * Once the times is up the students have 5 minutes to upload the Excel file with the intermediate calculations.

## FAQ

* If student can enter the exam.
  * Please exit and try again.
* If that does not work or there is a problem because the program consider that the student has already submitted the exam, then allow the student to do it again increasing the number of times allowed to be submitted.

## DOUBTS

* How can I increase the number of allowed submissions for a single student?

* How and when to activate "Solicitud de revisi√≥n de examen" ?
* Why there are two of them?

* When is it open the "Final individual practical exercise"
  * Does it have a password?
  * Do we set the timing?
  * If we explain the exam for 5 - 10 min then when does the time starts?
  * Do we set the start time 10 minutes after the official time? Or do we opened it while we explain, and they have an effective time of 1 hour and ten minutes?

* Shall we create the AIKEN files?
