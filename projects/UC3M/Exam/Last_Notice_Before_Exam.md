SUBJECT: EXAM Reminder

Hi Everyone,

Just a small reminder for the exam next Monday, May 8th.

**Each student should bring a computer device with a running MS Excel instance to complete the exercise (alternatively, you can connect to AulaVirtual).**

I would recommend using your own desktop version of Excel instead of the one on "AulaVirtual".
As a UC3M student, you can download Excel from your Microsoft UC3M account. See -> <https://www.uc3m.es/sdic/software/microsoft-office-365#aplicacionesdeofficeinstalable>

And let me remind you again:

Here's a brief summary of the links available in "Aula Global" to help you review the subject and prepare for the exam:

"Aula Global" -> "Exam Details"

- exam_details_preparation.pdf
This document provides a review of all the sections and recommended documentation to study.

- Exam_Instructions_XX.pdf
This document contains detailed instructions for the exam for this class.

**IMPORTANT:** Additional exercises from previous exams have been added.

I'd like to emphasize once more that the section "Aula Global" -> "Guide_Solutions_to_Exercises_Previous_Exams" has been updated with more exercises from previous exams.

Regards,
