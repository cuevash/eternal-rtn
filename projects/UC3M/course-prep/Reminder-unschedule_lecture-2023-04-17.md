REMINDER: Make-up Lecture Today, April 17th

Dear All,

I would like to remind you that I will be giving a make-up lecture today, April 17th, at the usual time 19:00 to 21:00, to compensate for the missed lecture earlier.

For those unable to attend, the recorded lecture will be uploaded for your convenience.

Best regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
