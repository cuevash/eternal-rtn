Good day, everyone,

I would like to clarify some points raised in the emails sent about the preliminary delivery.

1) I have asked some of you to clarify the group number and the members of the group. Although I have access to this information, it would be helpful to have it clearly stated in the delivery. Additionally, in rare cases, an assigned group member may not be an active participant. Thus, if the group number and its members have not been identified clearly on the Excel file, please email me with that information.

2) I have noted that some groups may have not followed very well the instructions for steps 2, 3, and 6. In these instances, you do not need to make any changes at this point. However, please ensure that these sections are improved for the final delivery.

3) Lastly, the most important point is that I have requested some groups to clarify the datasets they will use to create the final project. For those groups, I am asking for more detailed information.
To those groups I am requesting that you provide URL links that grant access to publicly accessible CSV, TXT, Excel files or links that allow for an online preview, such as on Kaggle or similar. Alternatively provide links to Google Drive files in CSV, TXT, Excel format or similar, with read permissions granted for easy access.
This is important, and you should provide this information as soon as possible, so I can verify that the dataset is correct.

FINAL DELIVERY:

Now, for the final delivery, please follow the instructions in the document "Aula Global" -> FINAL-PROJECT-STATEMENT.

And use the document "Aula Global" ->  "Final Delivery" -> "Team xx-ControlCard-v 1.0 File" as template.

Lastly, do not forget to deliver the video as explained in the document FINAL-PROJECT-STATEMENT.

If you require further clarification on how to proceed, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Wishing you a pleasant Easter holiday!

Regards,
Hector Cuevas
