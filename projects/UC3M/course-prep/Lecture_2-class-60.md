# Lecture Notes - Day II

## Introduction

* Start to record the lecture

* Have you all excel installed?
* I have published how to configure Excel in English with some sort or international handling of numbers.
  * "." for decimal and "," for thousandths separator
  * "," for variable separator in formulas

* Also, to have the usual day/month/year date format it is a good idea to use English UK in the regional settings.

**SHARE AULA GLOBAL AND SHOW LINK**

* There is link in aula global to some videos of the course of intermediate spreadsheets. It could be good to have a look at them for those with very little knowledge of Excel.

* It will definitely give you the initial boost that you may need

* There is also an online course that has the videos and some exercises

* All the slides of the block 1 are already published. I will publish everything on the next days. So you can have a look in advance.

The class today is going to be structured as:

* Intro to project

  * Get to know basic excel and quite a few of the possibilities for formatting
  * We will do some simple exercises. One of them in pairs
  * At the end of the class, like in 1:15 the 1 minute quiz will be opened

* Final project
  * Show in Aula global
  * Final delivery date will be updated
  * Groups of 3 persons
