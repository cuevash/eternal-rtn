Good day, everyone,

A reminder of a few things about the final project.

The groups must be of 3 people. There may be some justified exceptions and then be 2 or 1 person/s.

Most of you had already signed up for a group. But there were still people who were not signed up. So those who were not signed up I have assigned them to a group.

Please read the final project requirements carefully. Look at all the documentation in the "Aula Global", in the "Final Project" section.

Important! In that section you have the document "Team xx-ControlCard-v 1 0File" which is a template of what you are expected to create for the final project.

In the first delivery you only have to fill in the part that is specified in the document "Final Project statement and guidelines".

And finally be aware, also, of some final projects examples in "Final Project" section that can help you to understand the scope of the final project.

Regards

Hector Cuevas


Hello everybody,

Just to let you know that the Quiz number 4 has not been opened this week. It will be opened next week.

That is because it has a question over pivot charts that we will see next Monday.

Cheers
