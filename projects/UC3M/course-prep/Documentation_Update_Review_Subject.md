Important: Documentation and Exercises Solutions Update

This is a summary of all the documents and files recently uploaded to help you review the subject and prepare for the final exam.

First:

There is a new section in "Aula Global" -> "Functions (Text, Date, Table...) details". It contains the following files:

- Text_Date_Table_Functions.pdf
- Text_And_Date_Functions.xlsx.zip

The first one highlights the importance of some functions related to Text, Dates, and Table and provides some useful links with examples and more in-depth explanations of their use. Keep in mind that some of these functions are frequently used in exam exercises. The second file is an Excel file showing examples of some of the functions.

Second:

In each "Unit" section, there is a new subsection called "Solutions, Examples & Helper Documents". This subsection contains a PDF file explaining the different files in the accompanying Excel files.
There is also an accompanying zip file that contains a set of Excel files showing examples and solutions to many exercises presented in the theory. Some of these exercises have been solved during the course, but some have not, and it is definitely helpful to have a reference on how to solve them.

Third and quite IMPORTANT!

There is a new section called "Guide_Solutions_to_Exercises_Previous_Exams".

This section contains the following files:

- Guide_Solutions_to_Exercises_Previous_Exams.pdf
- Data_Solutions.zip

The PDF file is a guide on how to solve, sometimes step by step, a collection of exercises from previous exams. It includes reasoning and details about the different steps needed to solve them, as well as some precautions to take. The zip file is a collection of Excel files referenced in the PDF file with the solutions explained in that document.

I hope that all these new examples and exercises can help you all gain a more in-depth knowledge of Excel and make you better prepared for the final exam.

As a reminder:

I highly recommend that you use these materials to prepare for Training Quiz 1, which will take place on Monday. This will help you evaluate your level of preparedness. And obviously, I encourage you to take this Training exercise to test your knowledge.
