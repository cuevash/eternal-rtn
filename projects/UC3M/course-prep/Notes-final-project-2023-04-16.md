Important: Final project dataset

Hello everyone,

As you start working on your final project, you may find that your chosen dataset doesn't allow you to meet all the requirements needed for successful completion. If this happens, please don't worry. You have the option to switch to a different dataset. Just make sure to inform me about the new dataset you'll be using.

Best regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
