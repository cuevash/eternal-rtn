Subject:  "Training Quiz I" and "Training Quiz II" are opened.

Hi everyone,

The "Training Quiz I" and "Training Quiz II" in "Aula Global" are open and will remain so until the day of the exam.

You can attempt them multiple times. In fact, it is recommended to do so a few times since they have more than 10 questions and are presented randomly.

Keep in mind that you can navigate to any question directly using the sidebar.

Regards,
