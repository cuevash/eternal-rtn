Hi Everyone,

Here's a brief summary of the links available in "Aula Global" to help you review the subject and prepare for the exam:

"Aula Global" -> "Exam Details"

- exam_details_preparation.pdf
This document provides a review of all the sections and recommended documentation to study.

- Exam_Instructions_XX.pdf
This document contains detailed instructions for the exam for this class.

IMPORTANT: Additional exercises from previous exams have been added.

I'd like to emphasize once more that the section: "Aula Global" -> "Guide_Solutions_to_Exercises_Previous_Exams" has been updated with more exercises from previous exams.

Regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
