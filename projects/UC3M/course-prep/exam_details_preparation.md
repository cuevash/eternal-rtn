# Review Recommendations

## Review all the theory on the slides

##  Review documentation in "Aula Global" -> Functions (Text, Date, Table...) details"

It contains the following files:

- **Text_Date_Table_Functions.pdf**
- **Text_And_Date_Functions.xlsx.zip**

The first one highlights the importance of some functions related to Text, Dates, and Table and provides some useful links with examples and more in-depth explanations of their use. Keep in mind that some of these functions are frequently used in exam exercises. The second file is an Excel file showing examples of some of the functions.

##  Review the Examples and Exercises proposed through the course

In each "Unit" section, there is a new subsection called "Solutions, Examples & Helper Documents". This subsection contains a PDF file explaining the different files in the accompanying Excel files.
There is also an accompanying zip file that contains a set of Excel files showing examples and solutions to many exercises presented in the theory. Some of these exercises have been solved during the course, but some have not, and it is definitely helpful to have a reference on how to solve them.
