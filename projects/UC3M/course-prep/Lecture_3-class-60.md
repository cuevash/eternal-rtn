# Lecture Notes - Day II

## Introduction

* Start to record the lecture
* Ok. Welcome everybody. We are not going to waste any time today. There is plenty of things that we need to see.
And because we have like four bank holidays we need to optimize the time as much as possible. So the idea is to go a bit fast today and then will be able to go at more normal speed the rest of the days

**SHARE AULA GLOBAL AND SHOW LINK**

* Remind them of:

* There is link in aula global to some videos of the course of intermediate spreadsheets. It could be good to have a look at them for those with very little knowledge of Excel.

* Go over the dates of the final project. the date of the first delivery is actually a week later than it was before.

* I have published all the slides of the whole course. So you can look at them whenever you want.
it is always a good idea to have a look to them before the lecture, so you have an idea of what we are going to do.

The class today is going to be structured as:

* Theory, with exercises.

* Remind them to join a group of three persons on each group
