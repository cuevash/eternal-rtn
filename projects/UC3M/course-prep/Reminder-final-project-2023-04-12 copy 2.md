URGENT: Final project datasets verification

Hello everyone,

Before the Easter holidays, I requested some groups to update or clarify the information about their datasets. However, some groups have not yet done so.

For those groups that I asked to clarify their datasets, please do so as soon as possible. I need to validate the datasets to ensure that you will be able to fulfill all the requirements for the final project.

To clarify, I am requesting the following information to identify a dataset for verification purposes:

"Lastly, the most important point is that I have requested some groups to clarify the datasets they will use to create the final project. For those groups, I am asking for more detailed information. To those groups, I am requesting that you provide URL links that grant access to publicly accessible CSV, TXT, Excel files, or links that allow for an online preview, such as on Kaggle or similar. Alternatively, provide links to Google Drive files in CSV, TXT, Excel format or similar, with read permissions granted for easy access. This is important, and you should provide this information as soon as possible, so I can verify that the dataset is correct."

Please provide this information promptly so I can proceed with the validation process.

Best regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
