Important: Recuperating a Missed Lecture Day

Hello everyone,

As we missed a day of lectures, we need to make up for the lost time.
Therefore, I propose that we have an extra lecture next Monday, April 17th, at the usual time from 19:00 to 21:00.

If you cannot attend, you will be able to watch the uploaded lecture.

Best regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
