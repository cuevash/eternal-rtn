Subject: Make-up Lecture on Visualization Techniques, PivotTables, and PivotCharts + Quizzes Q7 & Q8 Reminder

Hi everyone,

I hope you're all doing well.

Yesterday, I conducted a make-up lecture on visualization techniques, PivotTables, and PivotCharts. In case you missed it or would like to review the material, the video has been uploaded to Aula Global. To access the video, navigate to "Aula Global" -> "Lecture Videos" -> "Lecture 6".

Please note that Quizzes Q7 and Q8 will be open until 21:00 hours today, April 18th. I encourage you to review the lecture slides before attempting these quizzes.

Best regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
