* What's happening these days?
* Data explosion. There is a exponential growth in generating data.
  * There is more data being generated on the last years that in the previous human history.
  * Is becoming more and more important to learn how to handle that data
  * We are collecting not only more data than ever, if not we are collecting lots of
  different types of data that we were not collecting before.
  * So it is changing the amount of data we collect as well as the variety of data that we collect.
* So, with all this huge amount of data, excel can be the first step to manage and exploit it.
Obviously, when the amount of data to handle is huge you will need some other tools, but quite a few of the skills you need to use Excel efficiency will be transferable to those tools

### 8

* I think it is a good idea to think about our modern systems on this way:

* Software is the soul of any system and defines how to the system works.
* Meanwhile, data is what we feed to the system to produce meaningful results.

* And the spreadsheets are the first step into data management.

  * It means as well that you can extend Excel with programming. It allows you to

### 14

* Let's talk about the structure of the course

  * First one is the first contact, and we learn some basic and common things.
  * The second one is the longest one, and it will focus in building, understanding and exploiting data
  * And the third one, we will learn how to represent information, how to automate tasks and a bit of how to make applications
  
### 16

* We will be able to get one day more because we will not be doing the presentation online. In your final project you'll
have to make a short video about the project. And instead of presenting it you will just send it to me.

### Final things to consider

* I will be using an English version on mac.
* I will use the comma as decimal separator and the dot as the thousands
* So , it will be an English version with Spanish settings.
* If you use this configuration then the separator on the formulas will be semicolon instead of comm
* Things to consider:
  * , or ; -> It depends of your regional settings on your computer
    * Windows -> <https://www.excel-exercise.com/comma-or-semicolon-in-excel-formula/>
    * Mac -> you can set some regional aspects on the system preferences
