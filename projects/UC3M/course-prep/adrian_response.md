Hello Adrian,

First things firstdd:

If the dataset that you are referring to is just the postal codes dataset, I'm sorry, but it is not enough. It is more like a dataset you would use just to geolocate some other geographical data. You need a dataset with values that you can add up, filter, group by, etc.

Please review all the documentation related to the final project carefully. And being so late in the game, I would recommend going for one of the official datasets that are on the "Aula Global," like "Sports (NBA)" or some other.

Any latest version of Excel should be able to handle all the typical font standards out there. It is worth investigating the reason why it is not recognizing the text fonts.

I think what happens is that when you imported the data from the CSV, you may have not chosen the correct format of the text. Or it may be because you have some options chosen by default as language settings. Though I think the first thing is the most probable. Please dedicate time to understand this. As in the exam, there will probably be an Excel file that will contain accents.

Regarding the maps, for the 3D maps to work, you need to add an option. I don't remember off the top of my head, but it should be pretty easy to find out by doing a quick search on the internet. It may be on the slides as well, but definitely, the search should give you the answer much more quickly. In any case, I would recommend using just the 2D map. I think it fits better for most cases.

Sometimes is better not to try to overcomplicate things. At least at the beginning.

If you could send me a link to the dataset you were trying to use, I can have a look. Anyway, if you are using another file that gives you similar information, that is fine as well.

If you have more doubts, please don't hesitate to contact me. Also, we can arrange a video call if you think you need more clarifications. Just let me know. But please review all the documentation related to the final project carefully.

Regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
