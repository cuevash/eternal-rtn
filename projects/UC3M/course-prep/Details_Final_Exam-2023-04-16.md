Final Exam

Hello everyone,

In tomorrow's lecture, I will additionally explain:

Some details about useful text and date functions, providing links and a small Excel file with basic examples. The links will showcase more examples. Some of these functions may be needed for calculations on the exam.

Details about the final exam.

On the lecture of the 24th, I will open a mock exam, so you can practice and get a sense of what the real exam will be like.

Additionally, in about a week, I will upload some questions from previous exams along with their solutions.

Best regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
