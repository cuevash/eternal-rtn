## General Comments

We are going to operate like this were either a job we have to do or an exam we have to do.

* First keep the original files somewhere
* Second on the clone file, keep the original sheet and make a copy where you are going to work.
It is always a good idea to have something to get back to. In case that something goes wrong. Excel does not always record all actions, so some actions can be reverted. Keep that in mind while you are working.
