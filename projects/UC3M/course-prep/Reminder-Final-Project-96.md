Good day, everyone,

A reminder of a few things about the final project.

The groups must be of 3 people. There may be some justified exceptions and then be 2 or 1 person/s.

Groups should be formed by the middle of next week. People who are not in any group or who are not three in a group will be reassigned so that everyone is in a group. And that these groups are of three.
In some justified exceptions the groups may then be of 2 or 1 person.

Please read the final project requirements carefully. Look at all the documentation in the "Aula Global", in the "Final Project" section.

Important! In that section you have the document "Team xx-ControlCard-v 1 0File" which is a template of what you are expected to create for the final project.

In the first delivery you only have to fill in the part that is specified in the document "Final Project statement and guidelines".

And finally be aware, also, of some final projects examples in "Final Project" section that can help you to understand the scope of the final project.

Regards

Hector Cuevas
