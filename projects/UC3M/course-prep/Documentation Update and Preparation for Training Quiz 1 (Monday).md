Hello everyone,

I am currently finalizing some documentation to assist you in reviewing the subject and preparing for the final exam.

I would like to inform you that these files will be uploaded shortly, later today (Friday). You can access them at your convenience.

I highly recommend that you use these materials to prepare for Training Quiz 1, which will take place on Monday. This will help you evaluate your level of preparedness.
And obviously I encourage you to take this Training exercise to test your knowledge.

Please note that I will post another notice with more details when the documentation is ready.

Best regards,

HÃ©ctor Cuevas
