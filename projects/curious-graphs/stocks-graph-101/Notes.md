# Notes:

# Files
Most of the files are work in progress. The only useful one right now is the climatology-temperature-anomalies.py that is the Application created on the CDS toolbox (<https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox-editor/150733/climatology-temperature-anomalies>).

Simple CDS Application graphs to show the temperature climatologies differences to the 1981-2010 normals.
This is called anomalies.
