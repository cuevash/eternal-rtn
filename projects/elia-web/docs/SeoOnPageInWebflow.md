I would like to address a few things:

 Firstly, the capabilities explained in step 2 seem to be too generic. It was expected that something more specific would be provided regarding what the dashboards would offer.
 Secondly, there seems to be some confusion regarding steps 3 and 6. Please refer to the 'Example Preliminary Delivery' file in 'Aula Global' for a small example of these steps.

Finally, and the most important point. It is important to note that it is not clear which dataset you are using for the project. To assess whether the data is adequate for the project, I will need you to provide the table or tables that you will use. Simply stating that you are getting data from some place is insufficient. Please provide this information as soon as possible so that we can ensure that the data is adequate to meet all the requirements of the final project.

For this matter, we ended up using Kaggle, specifically: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uzairrehman/world-wide-unicorn-startups?resource=download>

Preliminary Delivery Group 60

There is no information about the group or its members in the Excel file. Who are the members?

It is important to follow the structure and format provided in the 'Team xx-ControlCard-v 1.0 File'.

Have that in consideration for the final delivery.

I noticed that it is not clear which dataset you are using for the project. To assess whether the data is adequate for the project, I will need you to provide the table or tables that you will use. It is insufficient to simply state that you are getting data from some place. Please provide this information as soon as possible, as it is necessary for both of us to ensure that the data is adequate to carry out all the requirements of the final project.
