* Ideas for clustering data related to credit card transactions:
  * Marketing by customer grouping
    * Which possible knowledge will be good to know to make relevant marketing actions?
      * Range of spending (how much)
      * Recurring spending.
      * Recurring spending on certain dates of month/quarter/etc.
      * How often in red numbers
        * How long do they take to clear the debts
        * Which ones don't clear the debts?
          * Any early signs that predict in any significance way this result
      * Which customers make more one off purchases?
        * What are the characteristics of these customers? 
        * What marketing could be actionable on these customers
      * Which cross-selling could be offered to the customers?
        * Which characteristics will be looking for to offer certain cross-selling options 
      * In case that some cross-selling marketing is done due to data analysis:
        * Monitor and fine tune the marketing to improve results.
      * Mixing behavior and demographics to decide marketing actions  
    * Identifying relevant features from the customers and their transactions
      * Such as:
        * Type of purchases
        * 
    * K-means
      * Identify the optimum number of clusters
      * Analyze the resulting clusters and whether that add any significance actionable knowledge
    * PCA
      * We use PCA to reduce to a number of most relevant dimensions and on this way
      simplify the analyst of the clustering results
  * It may be possible to reproduce partially the document from McKinsey, obviously,
  adopting it to the Spanish market and the data available to us.
    * From this document, which aspects will be worthy of exploring ? 

* First exploratory surface
  * Get to know your customers as much as possible
    * Behavior
    * Demographics
      * Age
      * Study
      * Neighborhood
